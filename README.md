# What is this?
<ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
    <li>Ants (purple and blue pixels) follow pheromone trails in order to find their way to and from food sources.</li>
    <li>Green pheromones attract ants who are looking for food.</li>
    <li>Red pheromones attract ants who are looking to return to the ant hill (red center circle) with food they've collected.</li>
    <li>As an ant leaves the ant hill, it produces red pheromones.</li>
    <li>As an ant leaves a food source (pink rectangle), it produces green pheromones.</li>
    <li>Overtime, trails of pheromones will form which will act to guide other ants in finding food and returning home.</li>
</ul>
